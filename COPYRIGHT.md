About Us
The Mi’gmaq Research Partnership (MRP) is a partnership between the McGill Linguistics Department, Concordia Linguistics Department and the Listuguj First Nations Community  (located in the Gaspé region of Québec). The collaboration is a collective effort to bring Mi’gmaq speakers, teachers, and linguists together to develop a deeper understanding of the grammar of the language, teaching material, and to facilitate the learning, speaking, and promotion of Mi’gmaq.

This website is a point of contact for Mi’gmaq language learners, teachers, and supporters from Listuguj, QC. Learn more about who is involved under the drop-down menu at the top of the About Us Page.
