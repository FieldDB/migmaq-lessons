<h1>1. Introductions</h1>
<p>This lesson starts learners out in the language with the			main ways they can describe themselves and their relations:			their name, their parents, and where they come from, where they live, and			where they work.			Being about to name their parents (and where they come from) right off is			a particularly important part of self-introduction for learners,			since this allows older speakers from their community to place them			among the people they know.		</p>
