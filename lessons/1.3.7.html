<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="../img/wikiimage.png" alt="Trees" style="max-width: 75%"><p>This begins a series of lessons that use the key idea of			'see' to introduce the four-way pattern of 'see [{animate, inanimate}			{singular, plural}]'.			This lesson starts with nemi'g 'I see him/her [= animate singular]'; the			later ones will work through the other three possibilities.			This lesson also introduces the ending -igtug, added to mark a word as a			location. Armed with these three basic components (noun, verb,			location), the lesson (perhaps most importantly of all) shows			learners that even this early on, they can already make their own			full, complete, and real-world-useful sentences. This will be a theme			in the course overall.			For visuals, the original singular person images are put together with			the "see" image.		</p>
