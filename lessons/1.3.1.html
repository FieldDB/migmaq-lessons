<h1>Person Vocab</h1>
<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="../img/wikiimage.png" alt="Trees" style="max-width: 75%"><p>Introduces a core set of animate nouns starting from			people, going through primary gender + stage of life. This is more			than just simple vocabulary. These words will be the anchors for			demonstrating many other patterns in later lessons, which is one			reason why they are kept to this bare but still useful minimum. It is			also why the introduction of these words is slow and repetitive over			this and the next two lessons, which give the plural, then the			singular and plural together.			The images for each noun are crucial to making the set easy to learn and			remember. They are given together as a single row, and if possible,			it would help to highlight each image as its sound is read through.		</p>
