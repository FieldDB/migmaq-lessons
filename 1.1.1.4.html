<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="../img/wikiimage.png" alt="Trees" style="max-width: 75%"><P>In the last unit you should have recognized the pattern that we showed you in the previous two units: verbs about I/me have no ending, verbs about you end in n, verbs about he/she end in t. Also remember that family members belonging to I/me begin with n and that family members belonging to you begin with g.</P>
<p><h2>Migmaq transcription</h2><h2>A: Hi, what's your name?</h2></p>
<p>Don’t worry if you didn’t understand every word in the dialogue, just make sure that you understand the verb patterns we went over in the previous units.</p>
