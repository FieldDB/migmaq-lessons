Repository for website hosting Mi'gmaq language lessons.

Directory structure:

Source code:
	data: contains the xml, xslt, and python files used to generate the webcode.

Media:
	audio: audio recordings by Mi'gmaq speakers
	img: images used on site

Styles:
	css: CSS code. All changes should be made to custom.css, not the Bootstrap files.
	fonts: fonts for the site
	js: Javascript code

Documentation:
	documentation: website plans and documentation. These files do not appear on the website

Generated webfiles:
	sections: webpages for each section of the curriculum; generated by big.py
	units: webpages for each unit of the curriculum; generated by big.py
	lessons: webpages for each language lesson; generated by big.py
	dialogs: webpages for each dialog; generated by big.py
	vocabs: webpages for each vocab section; generated by big.py

Jekyll:
	_site: contains the actual website code; auto-generated by running jekyll build
	_layouts: contains Jekyll layouts to be applied to webfiles
	_includes: code snippets that Jekyll pastes into webfiles

To build the website, run make. The Makefile will run the python scripts if necessary and build Jekyll. 

Jekyll output should not be committed to this repository, only source code. [Currently -site is committed as well because we are using free bitbucket website hosting]

This repository is now public, since we have permission to use the audio files.
