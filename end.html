    		<p>You've learned so much and worked so hard! Congratulations!</p>
    		<p>Now it's time to go practice off-line. Find some speakers, if you can, and try to talk to them. Reach out to other speakers online (click on the Facebook logo to find our Facebook page for a start). Challenge yourself to use Mi'gmaq as much as possible!</p>
