               <unitintro>Did you notice the pattern? When you are talking about yourself (I / me) there is no ending on the verb teluisi but when are talking about what someone else (you) are doing teluisi needs an n at the end - teluisin.</unitintro>

               <unitintro>Did you notice the pattern? When you are talking about someone else (he / she) the verb teluisi ends in a t - teluisit. ALSO, When talking about your own family members the person begins in an n but when talking about someone else’s (your) family members the person begins in g - (e.g. nujj vs. gujj).</unitintro>

               <unitintro>In the last unit you should have recognized the pattern that we showed you in the previous two units: verbs about I/me have no ending, verbs about you end in n, verbs about he/she end in t. Also remember that family members belonging to I/me begin with n and that family members belonging to you begin with g.</unitintro>
