    		<p>This is a website for learning the Mi'gmaq language online. It can be used independently, or to supplement classroom learning.</p>
    		<p>In each section, you will find units consisting of lessons on related topics. In each lesson, you will learn new vocabulary, practice short dialogs, and do exercises to practice what you have learned so far. You will be able to listen to recordings of different Mi'gmaq speakers so that you can practice listening and speaking in Mi'gmaq above all else.</p>
    		<p>These lessons were developed by the Mi'gmaq Partnership between Listuguj Education Directorate, McGill University, and Concordia University. As a result, most of the speakers are from Listuguj, and their pronunciation may be different from that in your home community.</p>
